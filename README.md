# Algerian Forest Fire Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting forest fire incidents in Algeria using machine learning models. The primary goal is to develop a system that can provide early warnings and assist in managing and mitigating the impact of forest fires.

## Features

- Predicts forest fire incidents based on various environmental factors.
- Utilizes the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for accurate predictions.
- Web application for user-friendly interaction and predictions.
- Integration of a Ridge Regression model for machine learning predictions.
- Provides a user interface to input environmental data and receive predictions.
